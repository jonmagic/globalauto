h1. Vanilla

h2. Intro

Besides being one of my fav flav's, this is a barebones app with just the right mix of gems and plugins and configuration to make a perfect vanilla puddin.

h2. Gems

* will_paginate
* mocha
* RedCloth
* aasm
* factory_girl
* shoulda
* quietbacktrace

h2. Plugins

* asset_packager
* jrails
* limerick_rake
* squirrel

h2. Configuration

vanilla is configured to use sqlite3 for its db, and http basic auth for ALL controllers (because its setup in ApplicationController as a before filter). config/settings.yml is where the username and password go.
